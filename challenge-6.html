<!--6a.
Create a variable called hour and save the current hour of the day
(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!' in the console
If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console-->

<!--6b.

Continuing from 6a, try changing the value in the hour variable to make it display different messages.-->


<!--c.
Continuing from 6a, create a variable called name and save your name inside (as a string).
Update the if-statement to display your name in each message.
Example:
Good morning ${name}!-->

        if(hour>=6 && hour<=12){

<!--6d.

Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for:
children (6 years and younger) or
seniors (65 years and older)

Tasks:
Create a variable age and save a person’s age inside.
Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount.
If they do, display 'Discount' in the console.
Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
Try changing the age variable to display different messages.-->

<!--6e.
Continuing from exercise 6d, let’s say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday.
Create a variable:
const isHoliday = true;
Update the code so that in order to get a discount:
people must meet the age requirement and
it must not be a holiday.
Note: && has a higher priority than ||, so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script>
      const age = 5;
      const isHoliday = true;

      // && has a higher priority than || so for
      // this to work correctly, we need to add
      // brackets () around the || check to make
      // sure that it gets done first.
      if ((age <= 6 || age >= 65) && !isHoliday) {
        console.log('Discount');
      } else {
        console.log('No discount');
      }
    </script>
  </body>
